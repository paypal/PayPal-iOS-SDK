PayPal iOS SDK
==============

The PayPal iOS SDK provides a software library that makes it easy for iOS developers
to accept both credit cards and PayPal directly within native mobile apps.

For an introduction, see the
[PayPal Mobile SDK Overview](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/mobile-sdk-overview/).

Overview
--------

* The PayPal iOS SDK...
    1. Takes care of the UI to gather payment information from the user.
    2. Coordinates payment with PayPal.
    3. Returns to you a proof of payment.
* Your code...
    1. Receives proof of payment from the PayPal iOS SDK.
    2. [Sends proof of payment to your servers for verification](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/verify-mobile-payment/).
    3. Provides the user their goods or services.

Integration
-----------

### Requirements

* Xcode 4.5+ and iOS SDK 6.0+
* iOS 5.0+ target deployment
* armv7 and armv7s devices and the simulator (not armv6)
* iPhone and iPad of all sizes and resolutions


### Initial Setup

1. Clone or download the SDK, which consists of header files, license acknowledgements, release notes, and a static library. It also includes a sample app.
2. Add the `PayPalMobile` directory (containing several .h files and libPayPalMobile.a) to your Xcode project. We recommend checking "Copy items..." and selecting "Create groups...".
3. In your project's **Build Settings**, add `-lc++ -ObjC` to Other Linker Flags.
4. In your project's **Build Phases**, link your project with these libraries. Weak linking for iOS versions back to 5.0 is supported.
  * `AVFoundation.framework`
  * `AudioToolbox.framework`
  * `CoreMedia.framework`
  * `CoreVideo.framework`
  * `libxml2.dylib`
  * `MessageUI.framework`
  * `MobileCoreServices.framework`
  * `OpenGLES.framework`
  * `QuartzCore.framework`
  * `Security.framework`
  * `SystemConfiguration.framework`
  * `UIKit.framework`
5. Add the open source license acknowledgments from acknowledgments.md to [your app's acknowledgments](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3966116/where-to-put-open-source-credit-information-for-an-iphone-app).


### Credentials

Take note of these two identifiers:

  - `clientId`: Available on the [PayPal developer site](https://developer.paypal.com/).
  - `receiverEmail`: The email address on the PayPal account used to obtain the above `clientId`.


### Sample Code

1. Create a class (most likely a subclass of UIViewController) that conforms to PayPalPaymentDelegate.

    ```obj-c
    // SomeViewController.h
    #import "PayPalMobile.h"

    @interface SomeViewController : UIViewController<PayPalPaymentDelegate>
    // ...
    @end
    ```

2. In your implementation, create a `PayPalPayment` with an amount, a currency code, and a description.

    ```obj-c
    // SomeViewController.m

    - (IBAction)pay {

      // Create a PayPalPayment
      PayPalPayment *payment = [[PayPalPayment alloc] init];
      payment.amount = [[NSDecimalNumber alloc] initWithString:@"39.95"];
      payment.currencyCode = @"USD";
      payment.shortDescription = @"Awesome saws";

      // Check whether payment is processable.
      if (!payment.processable) {
        // If, for example, the amount was negative or the shortDescription was empty, then
        // this payment would not be processable. You would want to handle that here.
      }

      // continued below...
    ```

3. Create and display a `PayPalPaymentViewController` with the payment and your credentials (see above).

   **Tip:** Providing a `payerId` enables an improved experience
   for returning users. If you have a customer identifier that is *not* hardware- or device-based,
   such as an email address or a unique user ID in your system, you should provide it as a
   `payerId`; otherwise, pass `nil`.

    ```obj-c
      // ...continued from above

      // Start out working with the test environment! When you are ready, remove this line to switch to live.
      [PayPalPaymentViewController setEnvironment:PayPalEnvironmentNoNetwork];

      // Provide a payerId that uniquely identifies a user within the scope of your system,
      // such as an email address or user ID.
      NSString *aPayerId = @"someuser@somedomain.com";

      // Create a PayPalPaymentViewController with the credentials and payerId, the PayPalPayment
      // from the previous step, and a PayPalPaymentDelegate to handle the results.
      PayPalPaymentViewController *paymentViewController;
      paymentViewController = [[PayPalPaymentViewController alloc] initWithClientId:@"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
                                                                      receiverEmail:@"YOUR_PAYPAL_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
                                                                            payerId:aPayerId
                                                                            payment:payment
                                                                           delegate:self];

      // Present the PayPalPaymentViewController.
      [self presentViewController:paymentViewController animated:YES completion:nil];
    }
    ```

4. Write delegate methods to receive either the completed payment or a cancellation. These delegate methods
   are responsible for dismissing the modal view controller.

    ```obj-c
    // SomeViewController.m

    #pragma mark - PayPalPaymentDelegate methods

    - (void)payPalPaymentDidComplete:(PayPalPayment *)completedPayment {
      // Payment was processed successfully; send to server for verification and fulfillment.
      [self verifyCompletedPayment:completedPayment];

      // Dismiss the PayPalPaymentViewController.
      [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    }

    - (void)payPalPaymentDidCancel {
      // The payment was canceled; dismiss the PayPalPaymentViewController.
      [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    }
    ```

5. [Send the proof of payment to your servers for verification](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/verify-mobile-payment/),
   as well as any other processing required for your business, such as fulfillment.

   **Tip:** At this point, the payment has been completed, and the user
   has been charged. If you can't reach your server, it is important that you save the proof
   of payment and try again later.

    ```obj-c
    // SomeViewController.m

    - (void)verifyCompletedPayment:(PayPalPayment *)completedPayment {
      // Send the entire confirmation dictionary
      NSData *confirmation = [NSJSONSerialization dataWithJSONObject:completedPayment.confirmation
                                                             options:0
                                                               error:nil];

      // Send confirmation to your server; your server should verify the proof of payment
      // and give the user their goods or services. If the server is not reachable, save
      // the confirmation and try again later.
    }
    ```


6. **Optional:** Add a preconnect to PayPal's servers.

   We recommend doing the preconnect when you first display the view controller from which your users will initiate payment.
   (Do not preconnect significantly earlier than that, as the connection has a limited lifetime.)

    ```obj-c
    // SomeViewController.m

    - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
      [super viewWillAppear:animated];

      // Start out working with the test environment! When you are ready, remove this line to switch to live.
      [PayPalPaymentViewController setEnvironment:PayPalEnvironmentNoNetwork];
      [PayPalPaymentViewController prepareForPaymentUsingClientId:@"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"];
    }
    ```

Testing
-------

During development and testing, use `+setEnvironment:` to avoid moving real money around. See the header files
for more information.

International Support
---------------------

### Localizations

The SDK has built-in translations for many languages and locales. See the header files for a complete list.

### Currencies

The SDK supports multiple currencies. See [the REST API country and currency documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/rest_api_payment_country_currency_support/) for a complete, up-to-date list.

Note that currency support differs for credit card versus PayPal payments. Unless you disable credit card acceptance (via the `PayPalPaymentViewController.hideCreditCardButton` property), **we recommend limiting transactions to currencies supported by both payment types.** Currently these are: USD, GBP, CAD, EUR, JPY.

If your app initiates a transaction with a currency that turns out to be unsupported for the user's selected payment type, then the SDK will display an error to the user and write a message to the console log.

Hints & Tips
------------

  - **Avoid fraud!** Be sure to [verify the proof of payment](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/verify-mobile-payment/).
  - Mobile networks are unreliable. Save the proof of payment to make sure it eventually reaches your server.
  - The header files are thoroughly documented; refer to them as needed for extra details about any given property or parameter.

Older Libraries
---------------

PayPal is replacing the [Mobile Payments Libraries (MPL)](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/mobile/gs_MPL/)
with the PayPal iOS/Android SDK. The PayPal iOS/Android SDK is currently available in the US,
with more country support coming soon. US developers should upgrade now for more features
and a better mobile experience. Non-US developers can continue to use MPL for the time
being. Issues related to MPL should be filed in the [sdk-packages repo](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/).

Developers with existing Express Checkout integrations or who want additional
features such as authorization and capture, may wish to use [Mobile Express Checkout](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/mobile/gs_MEC/)
in a webview.
