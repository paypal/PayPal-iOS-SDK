## Use Cases

The SDK supports two use cases for making payments - **Single Payment** and **Future Payments** - and a third use case for obtaining information about the customer - **Profile Sharing**.


### Single Payment

Receive a one-time payment from a customer's PayPal account. This can be either (1) an **immediate** payment which your servers should subsequently **verify**, or (2) an **authorization** for a payment which your servers must subsequently **capture**, or (3) a payment for an **order** which your servers must subsequently **authorize** and **capture**:

1. [Accept a Single Payment](docs/single_payment.md) and receive back a proof of payment.
2. On your server, [Verify the Payment](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/verify-mobile-payment/), [Capture the Payment](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/capture-payment/#capture-the-payment), or [Process the Order](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/create-process-order/) (PayPal Developer site) using PayPal's API.

*Note:* Direct Credit Card (DCC) payments are now deprecated in this SDK.  Please use [Braintree Payments](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), a PayPal Company, which is the easiest way to accept PayPal, credit cards, and many other payment methods.


### Future Payments

Your customer logs in to PayPal just one time and consents to future payments:

1. [Obtain Customer Consent](docs/future_payments_mobile.md#obtain-customer-consent) to receive an authorization code.
2. On your server, use this authorization code to [Obtain OAuth2 Tokens](docs/future_payments_server.md#obtain-oauth2-tokens).

Later, when that customer initiates a payment:

1. [Obtain a Client Metadata ID](docs/future_payments_mobile.md#obtain-an-application-correlation-id) that you'll pass to your server.
2. On your server, [Create a Payment](docs/future_payments_server.md#create-a-payment) using your OAuth2 tokens, the Client Metadata ID, and PayPal's API.


### Profile Sharing

Your customer logs in to PayPal and consents to PayPal sharing information with you:

1. [Obtain Customer Consent](docs/profile_sharing_mobile.md#obtain-customer-consent) to receive an authorization code.
2. On your server, use this authorization code to [Obtain OAuth2 Tokens](docs/profile_sharing_server.md#obtain-oauth2-tokens).
3. On your server, [Retrieve Customer Information](docs/profile_sharing_server.md#retrieve-customer-information) using your OAuth2 tokens and PayPal's API.


## Requirements

* Xcode 7 and iOS SDK 9
* iOS 6.0+ target deployment
* armv7, armv7s, and arm64 devices, and the simulator (not armv6)
* iPhone and iPad of all sizes and resolutions


## Add the SDK to Your Project

### If you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), then add these lines to your podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'PayPal-iOS-SDK'
```

### If you don't use CocoaPods, then:

1. Clone or download the SDK, which consists of header files, license acknowledgements, release notes, and a static library. It also includes a sample app.
    * **As of version 2.12.0, the SDK requires Xcode 7 and iOS 8 SDK.**
2. Add the `PayPalMobile` directory (containing several .h files and libPayPalMobile.a) to your Xcode project. We recommend checking "Copy items..." and selecting "Create groups...".
3. In your project's **Build Settings** (in the `TARGETS` section, not the `PROJECTS` section):
  * add `-lc++ -ObjC` to `Other Linker Flags`
  * enable `Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)`
  * enable `Link Frameworks Automatically`
4. In your project's **Build Phases**, link your project with these libraries. Weak linking for iOS versions back to 6.0 is supported.
  * `Accelerate.framework`
  * `AudioToolbox.framework`
  * `AVFoundation.framework`
  * `CoreLocation.framework`
  * `CoreMedia.framework`
  * `MessageUI.framework`
  * `MobileCoreServices.framework`
  * `SystemConfiguration.framework`
  * `SafariServices.framework`

### With or without CocoaPods:

1. Add the open source license acknowledgments from acknowledgments.md to [your app's acknowledgments](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3966116/where-to-put-open-source-credit-information-for-an-iphone-app).
2. In your app's Info.plist, add the following URL schemes to `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`:
  * `com.paypal.ppclient.touch.v1`
  * `com.paypal.ppclient.touch.v2`
  * `org-appextension-feature-password-management`

## Credentials

Your mobile integration requires different `client_id` values for each environment: Live and Test (Sandbox).

Your server integrations for verifying or creating payments will also require the corresponding `client_secret` for each `client_id`.

You can obtain these PayPal API credentials by visiting the [Applications page on the PayPal Developer site](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/) and logging in with your PayPal account.

### Sandbox

Once logged in on this Applications page, you will be assigned **test credentials**, including Client ID, which will let you test your iOS integration against the PayPal Sandbox.

While testing your app, when logging in to PayPal in the SDK's UI you should use a *personal* Sandbox account email and password. I.e., not your Sandbox *business* credentials.

You can create both business and personal Sandbox accounts on the [Sandbox accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/applications/accounts) page.

### Live

To obtain your **live** credentials, you will need to have a business account. If you don't yet have a business account, there is a link at the bottom of that same Applications page that will get you started.


## International Support

### Localizations

The SDK has built-in translations for many languages and locales. See the header files for a complete list.

### Currencies

The SDK supports multiple currencies. See [the REST API country and currency documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/direct/rest_api_payment_country_currency_support/) for a complete, up-to-date list.

If your app initiates a transaction with a currency that turns out to be unsupported for the user's selected payment type, then the SDK will display an error to the user and write a message to the console log.


## Testing

During development and testing, set the environment to Sandbox or NoNetwork/Mock mode, to avoid moving real money around. See the header files for more information.


## Documentation

* These docs in the SDK, which include an overview of usage, step-by-step integration instructions, and sample code.
* The sample app included in this SDK.
* Header files are thoroughly documented; refer to them as needed for extra details about any given property or parameter.
* The [PayPal Developer Docs](https://developer.paypal.com/docs), which cover error codes and server-side integration instructions.


## Support

When opening an issue, please include the environment (live or sandbox), SDK version, and a `PayPal-Debug-ID`. The console log may have something like:

```
PayPal SDK: Request has failed with error: INTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR - System error. Please try again later. (500) | PayPal Debug-ID: 463acd5lba23c [live, PayPal iOS SDK 2.14.1]
```

Additionally, information about the types of devices (iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 5), iOS version, and any non-standard settings would be helpful to provide.

For merchant-specific issues, you should use the [PayPal Merchant Technical Support site](https://www.paypal-techsupport.com) to open an issue.

Please do **not** post your client ID or secret in an issue.


## Usability

User interface appearance and behavior is set within the library itself. For the sake of usability and user experience consistency, apps should not adjust appearance properties or attempt to modify the SDK's behavior beyond the documented methods in the provided headers.

Specifically, if you are using `UIAppearance` to modify the appearance of any UI elements in your app, you should reverse those changes prior to presenting our viewcontroller, and set them again after dismissing the viewcontroller.


## Next Steps

Depending on your use case, you can now:

* [Accept a single payment](docs/single_payment.md)
* [Obtain user consent](docs/future_payments_mobile.md) to [create future payments](docs/future_payments_server.md).
* [Obtain user consent](docs/profile_sharing_mobile.md) to [retrieve customer information](docs/profile_sharing_server.md).
